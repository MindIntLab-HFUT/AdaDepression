        "why are you going back to uni if it makes you overwhelmed and stressed, you do not want to do psychology anymore, and you already had a job you loved anyway? it does not sound like you want to go back to uni at all. i suggest you reconsider this course of action. i think you should speak to your doctor or any other specialist you are seeing about this, but i would not rush to abandon the job that you enjoy. you were able to do the job just fine before, so i think its likely that you will be able to do it again once the extra stress is taken off. i think, at the very least, you should wait a while and see how you feel about work once your stress has leveled out again. if you still want to quit work after your stress levels have stabilised give it at least a few weeks, then it might be time to talk to work about scaling back or even quitting, but do not do it without a plan of what you are going to do next. quitting in order to stay home and do nothing is not going to help. quitting or taking a break in order to get more intense therapy and work hard on your mental health is ok but do it with the support of your care team, not on a whim. quitting to heal may also be ok, but its important you have a plan of how that will work, the timeframe, and what you will do next. i think, also, if you do decide you need a break, you should try to take time off from your job rather than quit it entirely if possible, i know not all workplaces would allow this. i know what its like being so scared and i wish i could help you i have been scared like that too. please contact any support you have in place friends and family, as well as doctors, psychologists, counsellors... and discuss with them before you decide anything. find someone you trust and feel safe with who knows you well, because their advice will probably be far better than mine. right now you are doing too much, and that is what your anxiety is telling you. you need to be selective in what you remove from your life in order to bring it back to a manageable level, though. do not start by removing everything. remove one thing at a time until it becomes manageable again. i hope things improve for you soon.",

        "that is good, that is very good . do you have any other passions?",
        "you are missing out on a lot, yes. relationships are complex and allow you to explore a lot of different emotions and experiences that you would not get without a close intimate relationship. however, if you are happy with that, that is fine. there are a lot of experiences that people choose to miss out on. if you never go skydiving, you are missing out on the emotions and experiences that go along with that, but many people choose to miss those and they are still perfectly happy. if you never have children, you are missing out on emotions and experiences that go along with that, but many people choose not to have children or they are unable to and they still have happy lives. my point is, you can choose not to experience some things and still have a happy life, and that is up to you. and if you are happy without a relationship, stop reading here, because the rest is about how to find relationships. if you want a relationship, that is ok too. there are different types of relationships you can have casual or short-term relationship. seriouscommitted relationship if you want a short-term relationship, its a lot easier to get into, because long-term compatibility is not really a consideration. a lot of people do more short-term relationships when they are young teenagers, early 20s, so you are still in time to get involved in that if you want to. basically, the way you get into a short-term relationship is you think do i get on ok with this person? great! let us go on a date. then, if the date goes well, you continue the relationship until you come across something you cannot accept or until you want to end it for some other reason. if the date goes badly, you tell them its not working out and do not see them again. short-term relationships are easy to get into because the bar to start one is very low. you can probably find suitable partners for this on dating sites. if you are looking for a serious, committed relationship, its a lot harder to find because 90 of the dating pool gets rejected automatically. they might be good people, and fun to spend time with, but you do not want to spend the rest of your life with them and so you do not date them if you are thinking long-term. it sounds like maybe you are wired to look for more serious relationships, so it makes sense you have not found the right person yet. a lot of people settle down more once they reach their mid to late 20s, so before that point, its harder to find someone for a serious long-term relationship not impossible, just harder. its also harder to know where to look, because dating sites have a lot of people seeking casual relationships and very few looking for something more serious. i think the best way to find suitable partners for long-term relationships is just to meet a lot of people and make lots of friends, then allow relationships to escalate romanticallysexually if you feel the connection and it feels right. you might notice that short-term dating would lead into this quite well because it involves meeting and dating a lot of people - for some people its very effective, but for others the series of dates is exhausting. if you are in the find it exhausting category, its better to find someone you connect with as friends before you start dating. for me personally, when i am looking for a partner, i start looking for new friends. both of my long-term partners have been people who i initially described as a friend then became a fwb, then fwbbest friend, and then decided to start dating.",

        "hey bumpers, i am 36 weeks and am so tired. earlier in the pregnancy they determined i was pretty anemic and put me on iron pills and i remember before going on the pills i was so tired all the time but after going on them i felt better. now i am starting to feel how i did before again. its not just normal tired, its tired to the point of struggling a ton to get up in the morning for work and then struggling to get my work done and then struggling to stay at work till the end of the day. i feel like i am in a fog almost constantly. take today for example, i fell asleep at 2 in the morning a little late for me but whatever and slept until 12 noon today waking up once every 3-4 hours to pee but falling back asleep after quite easily and sleeping deeply. today when i woke up i was still exhausted for like an hour, i ate around 1 and was fine until like 2 when i felt dead exhausted again and fell asleep until just a little bit ago 430ish and i am still a little tired. this is how i felt before the iron pills and now i am wondering if this is normal third trimester woes or if this could mean my iron pills stopped working or are not working enough? does everyone feel this way third trimester? i am going to have them check my levels when i go in on wednesday but ugh this is terrible!",

        "just wondering. i had sex with a man 13 years my senior this summer, we did it about three times. he was a non-circumcised african man. preliminaries were really great, he quickly understood what i liked and could please me in every way. the penetration part was not as good, i did get some pleasure from it but it lasted only about 57min and, most surprising of all, i did not feel him coming at all. i know men last less and less with age, and of course, this was just a fling so i did not have interest or time to work on our lovemaking to make him last longer, but the fact that i did not feel him come at all surprised me a lot. we finished in different positions each time. have you ever experienced that before? is it correlated with age or not at all? i could always feel my youngersame age male partners come, regardless of penis size. despite this, i was still happy to have slept with him.",
